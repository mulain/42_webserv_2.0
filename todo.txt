readchunk must be bigger than maxheadersize

upload redir > httep redir. test new code in request class

rename networkfailure to terminal client failure or smth and expand information msg from just printing the function

test smal sendchunksize for stringstream end detection

sendchunk smller than header is problem. maybe just not allow below max headersize.
 own headers will never be that big anyway tho!

 handle fail in startListening: remove failed config. prbably make closefdandthrow a matriarcth function
 also if none remain, throw error

constify everything


constify getAltConfigs in config

read all mimetypes from file?

in updateVars: make a script subfunction and return early if script = true?
