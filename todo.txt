readchunk must be bigger than maxheadersize

http redir chains
upload redir > httep redir. test new code in request class


test smal sendchunksize for stringstream end detection

sendchunk smller than header is problem. maybe just not allow below max headersize.
 own headers will never be that big anyway tho!

 handle fail in startListening: remove failed config. prbably make closefdandthrow a matriarcth function
 also if none remain, throw error

constify everything

make an interface for sending reponses
- internal buffer
- file
- statusPage

test if statuspage sender actually keeps the stringstream position between read (need to send large msg)

remove delete from destructor and manually select point
or static allocate request and make assignment operator.
